This is an abridged set of TS structures for the allylation of benzaldehyde catalyzed by 2,2'-bipyriding-N,N'-dioxide for example purposes only!

see B. J. Rooks, M. R. Haas, D. Sepulveda, T. Lu, and S. E. Wheeler, "Prospects for the Computational Design of Bipyridine N,N′-Dioxide Catalysts for Asymmetric Propargylations", ACS Catal. 5, 272 (2015) and references cited therein.

Note:  Assumes ligand is C2-symmetric!
